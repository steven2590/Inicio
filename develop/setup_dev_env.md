# Set up a local web server

Tools like [jsbin](http://jsbin.com/?html,output) are helpful to play around with making small changes to simple webpages directly inside the browser, but when its time to roll up your sleeves, setting up a local web server so that you can make and fix mistakes rapidly is essential.

1. Ensure you have a local web server running<br>

> Not sure? you can find information about setting one up [**here**](https://gist.github.com/jgravois/5e73b56fa7756fd00b89).

    ```
    <html>
      <title>my first website</title>
      <body>
        Hello world!
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

2. Copy and paste the code snippet above
3. Save it as a new `.html` file on your own machine.
3. Open the file in your browser via `http`.  

> The exact location and name you use for the file will affect how construct the url (ie: [http://localhost/folder/file.html]).
